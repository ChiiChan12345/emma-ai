3. **Value Proposition**: What's in it for them
4. **Call to Action**: What you want them to do
5. **Next Steps**: Clear follow-up actions

### Example Email Content

```
Subject: Welcome to Emma AI, [Client Name]!

Your account is performing excellently! 
Have you considered our advanced features?
